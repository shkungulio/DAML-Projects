# Data-Analytics-and-Machine-Learning-Projects

Welcome to my Data Analytics and Machine Learning portfolio repository! This collection showcases various projects that highlight my skills in data exploration, visualization, predictive modeling, and machine learning.

Key Features:
* Data Preprocessing: Handling real-world datasets with missing values, feature engineering, and data cleaning.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering insights and trends using Python, R, and visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and ggplot2.
* Predictive Modeling: Building and evaluating models, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
* Machine Learning Algorithms: Implementing and tuning models like k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.
* Time Series Analysis: Forecasting trends and seasonality using ARIMA and Prophet.
* Data Visualization: Creating impactful dashboards and charts using tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Python libraries.
* Domain Applications: Projects include applications in healthcare, finance, and sports analytics.

This repository demonstrates my passion for transforming data into actionable insights and my commitment to building robust, scalable machine-learning solutions. Feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you have any feedback or questions!
