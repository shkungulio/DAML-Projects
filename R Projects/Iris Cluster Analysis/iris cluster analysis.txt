To perform Cluster Analysis using the Iris dataset in RStudio, follow these steps:

### 1. Load the necessary libraries
```R
# Install the necessary libraries if not already installed
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("cluster")

# Load the libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(cluster)
```

### 2. Load the Iris dataset
The Iris dataset is built into R, so you can directly load it using the `data()` function.

```R
# Load the Iris dataset
data(iris)

# Check the first few rows of the dataset
head(iris)
```

### 3. Preprocess the data
Since we are performing cluster analysis, it's important to remove the categorical variable (`Species`), as clustering algorithms typically work with numerical data.

```R
# Remove the Species column for clustering purposes
iris_data <- iris[, -5]  # Removing the 5th column (Species)
```

### 4. Normalize the data (optional but recommended for K-means clustering)
Normalization ensures that all features contribute equally to the distance metric.

```R
# Normalize the data (scale to have mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1)
iris_scaled <- scale(iris_data)
```

### 5. Determine the optimal number of clusters (Elbow method)
We will use the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters by plotting the total within-cluster sum of squares against the number of clusters.

```R
# Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters
wss <- numeric(15)  # Store WSS for k = 1 to 15
for (i in 1:15) {
  kmeans_model <- kmeans(iris_scaled, centers = i, nstart = 25)
  wss[i] <- kmeans_model$tot.withinss
}

# Plot the Elbow curve
plot(1:15, wss, type = "b", pch = 19, col = "blue", xlab = "Number of Clusters", ylab = "Total Within Sum of Squares")
```

Look for the "elbow" point on the graph where the decrease in the total within-cluster sum of squares slows down. This point suggests the optimal number of clusters.

### 6. Perform K-means clustering
Based on the elbow method result, choose the optimal number of clusters (let's assume it's 3).

```R
# Apply K-means clustering (assuming 3 clusters)
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
kmeans_result <- kmeans(iris_scaled, centers = 3, nstart = 25)

# View the cluster assignment for each observation
kmeans_result$cluster
```

### 7. Visualize the clusters
You can visualize the clusters in a 2D plot using `ggplot2`.

```R
# Add the cluster assignments to the original dataset
iris$Cluster <- as.factor(kmeans_result$cluster)

# Create a 2D scatter plot of the clusters
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "K-means Clustering of Iris Dataset", x = "Sepal Length", y = "Sepal Width")
```

### 8. Analyze the cluster centers
To understand the characteristics of each cluster, you can examine the cluster centers.

```R
# View the cluster centers
kmeans_result$centers
```

This gives you the mean values of the features for each cluster.

### 9. Evaluate clustering quality (optional)
You can evaluate how well the clustering performed by comparing it to the true species labels in the dataset.

```R
# Compare cluster results with actual species
table(iris$Species, kmeans_result$cluster)
```

### Business Understanding

**Problem Statement:**  
The goal is to segment the Iris dataset into meaningful clusters that represent patterns or groups based on flower attributes (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The key business question is:  
*How can we effectively categorize iris flowers based on their features to uncover natural groupings, and how does this align with the predefined species labels?*

This analysis can help in various applications such as:
- Enhancing botanical classification systems.
- Training machine learning models for predictive tasks.
- Providing insights into the natural clustering of biological data.

### Data Understanding

The **Iris dataset** is a widely-used dataset in data science and statistics for classification and clustering tasks. It includes 150 observations of iris flowers with four numerical attributes and one categorical attribute. Below is the data dictionary:

| **Variable Name** | **Description**                | **Type**   | **Units**         |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Sepal.Length       | Length of the sepal           | Numeric    | Centimeters       |
| Sepal.Width        | Width of the sepal            | Numeric    | Centimeters       |
| Petal.Length       | Length of the petal           | Numeric    | Centimeters       |
| Petal.Width        | Width of the petal            | Numeric    | Centimeters       |
| Species            | Species of the iris flower    | Categorical| Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica |

The dataset is preloaded in R as `iris`, making it easily accessible for analysis. Prior to clustering, the `Species` column is excluded to focus solely on numerical attributes. The data is normalized to standardize contributions from each variable in clustering algorithms like K-means.
